## Warp-Level Softmax Implementation

The naive softmax implementation launches a kernel where each thread processes individual rows, demonstrating suboptimal efficiency for large column sizes. Our optimized approach employs cooperative thread processing within warps to enhance memory access patterns and computational efficiency.

### Warp Reduction Primitive

The following code demonstrates a basic warp reduction implementation using CUDA primitives:

```cpp
inline __device__ float warpReduceMax(float* val, int thread_group = 32) {
#pragma unroll
  for (int lane_mask = thread_group/2; lane_mask > 0; lane_mask >>= 1) {
    val[0] = fmaxf(val[0],
      __shfl_xor_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, val[0], lane_mask, thread_group));
  }
  return 0.0f;
}
```

The `__shfl_xor_sync` warp shuffle primitive enables direct data exchange between threads within a warp, eliminating the need for global or shared memory access. The function parameters are:
- `mask`: Thread participation mask (0xFFFFFFFF for all threads)
- `val`: Value to shuffle
- `src_lane`: XOR mask for source lane calculation
- `width`: Warp size (typically 32)

For `thread_group=32`, the reduction process operates as follows:

1. **Initial iteration (lane_mask=16):**
   - Computes pairwise maxima between threads [0-15] and [16-31]
   - Results stored in first 16 threads

2. **Subsequent iteration (lane_mask=8):**
   - Processes remaining maxima in first 16 threads
   - Computes maxima between threads [0-7] and [8-15]

This logarithmic reduction pattern continues until the maximum value resides in thread 0.

### Block Reduction Strategy

To optimize thread utilization across varying column sizes:
- Configure blocks as 2D grids (block.x=32, block.y=4)
- Total threads per block: 128 (32×4)
- Enables parallel processing of 4 rows per block

This configuration balances:
- High thread occupancy (minimizing idle threads)
- Efficient memory access patterns
- Effective SM utilization

### Implementation Details

For a block configuration of 4×32 threads (y×x):

1. **Block-level reduction:**
   - Threads collaborate to compute row maxima
   - Strided access pattern (stride=32) ensures coalesced memory access

2. **Warp-level reduction:**
   - Final maxima computed via warp shuffle operations
   - Results stored in shared memory for block-wide access

```cpp
__shared__ float smem_val[block_size_y][2]; // [max, sum]

float local_max = -INFINITY;
for (int pack_id = 0; pack_id < num_packs; ++pack_id) {
  const int col_idx = pack_id * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (col_idx < n) {
    local_max = fmaxf(local_max, row_x[col_idx]);
  }
}
warpReduceMax(&local_max);

if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
  smem_val[threadIdx.y][0] = local_max;
}
__syncthreads();
```
